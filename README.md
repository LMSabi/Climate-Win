# Climate Change with CLimate Wins
Cimate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate
change around Europe and, potentially, the world. DIffernet tools are accessed to predict weather conditions and extreme climate events. The data set used is based on weather observations from 18 different weather stationsacross Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist foralmost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and
more. This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.
